# TaboolaIntershipTest

These files are intended for the take home test for the Backend Engineer Intern Take Home Test.

Getting started:

    App.java is the driver file for questions 1 and 2 of the test.

    ProductAndPriceHistoryScript.sql contains the script and query for question 3.

Notes:

    For questions 1 and 2, I assumed the input would come from keyboard entry.

    For question 3, I provided what I thought is a script and included the query requested in the same file.
